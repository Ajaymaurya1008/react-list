# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules. It is designed to help you quickly start a new React project with Vite, leveraging the benefits of fast builds and a modern development environment.

## Features

- **Fast Refresh**: Instant feedback on code changes without losing component state.
- **ESLint**: Pre-configured with some basic rules to help maintain code quality.
- **Minimal Setup**: Focus on coding rather than configuration.
- **Optimized Build**: Leverages Vite's fast build process for optimized production builds.
- **TypeScript Support**: Easily add TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
- **Live Search**: Implement live search functionality for a better user experience.
- **Code Optimization**: Ensures efficient and optimized code for better performance.

## Libraries and Packages

This template includes the following libraries and packages:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Official Vite plugin to integrate React with Vite using Babel.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc**: Official Vite plugin to integrate React with Vite using SWC.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **React-Hot-Toast**: A React component for displaying toast notifications.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework with a comprehensive set of components.

## Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available to integrate React with Vite:

### @vitejs/plugin-react

- **Repository**: [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)
- **Description**: This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to enable Fast Refresh in React applications. Babel is a widely-used JavaScript compiler that allows you to use the latest JavaScript features and syntax.
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  npm install @vitejs/plugin-react --save-dev
  ```
- **Usage**:
  ```javascript
  // vite.config.js
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
  import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react()]
  });
  ```

### @vitejs/plugin-react-swc

- **Repository**: [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)
- **Description**: This plugin uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) (Speedy Web Compiler) to enable Fast Refresh in React applications. SWC is a super-fast compiler written in Rust, designed to be a drop-in replacement for Babel with improved performance.
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  npm install @vitejs/plugin-react-swc --save-dev
  ```
- **Usage**:
  ```javascript
  // vite.config.js
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
  import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc';

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react()]
  });
  ```

## Getting Started

To create a new project using this template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview the production build**:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code of your React application.
  - `main.jsx`: Entry point of the application.
  - `App.jsx`: Main application component.
- `public/`: Contains static assets.
- `vite.config.js`: Vite configuration file.
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.

## ESLint Configuration

This template includes a basic ESLint configuration to help you maintain code quality. You can customize the rules by editing the `.eslintrc` file.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the project depends on the specific features and implementations. For example:

- **Live Search**: Typically, the time complexity for a live search feature is O(n) where n is the number of items being searched. Optimizations such as debouncing can improve performance.
- **Code Optimization**: Ensures that the code runs efficiently, often aiming for O(1) or O(log n) time complexity for critical operations.
